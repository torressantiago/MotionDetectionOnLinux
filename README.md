# MotionDetectionOnLinux
This repository aims to show the process of creating a daemon on GNU Linux on an embedded system.

For the motion detection part, I will be using a modified version of the code showcased at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/
